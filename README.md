To manage version control, the python notebooks are stored in this repository as .py instead of .ipynb. Editing and viewing of these notebooks will require Jupytext.

# Installing JupyterLab
JupyterLab will be accessed and installed through [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/windows/). After installation, search for the "Anaconda Navigator" in your start menu and open it. You should see a list of applications. Look for "JupyterLab" and press launch, this may prompt an installation if Jupyterlab is not yet installed. 

Some code will require installing external libraries with `pip`. Open 'Anaconda Powershell Prompt' and enter the comand `conda install pip`. Necessary libraries will later be installed through `pip install <library>`. (This step is not required to make any of the notebooks functional)

# Read files with Jupytext

Open JupyterLab through the Anaconda Navigator. Open the extensions tab to the left (puzzle icon), search for "jupyterlab-jupytext" and install. Restart JupyterLab for the extension to take effect. .py files can now be viewed through notebooks by right-clicking the file > open with > notebook.

From there the .py file can be run and interacted with as a notebook.

## Editing modules

When making edits make sure to clear all cell outputs before pushing changes to the repository.

If adding new modules/notebooks Jupytext allows for [converting .ipynb files to .py and vice versa](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using-cli.html). For this repository, __only push the .py version of the modules__. 

`\input` folder stores all the necessary datasets to be used. __Do not push any files that are generated by the code__ such as exported .csv files.
